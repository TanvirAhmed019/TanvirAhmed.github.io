## Relevant Projects
**Predicting Diabetes on Diagnostic using Machine Learning**
- This project is based on Pima Indian diabetes dataset which predicts whether the patient has diabetes or not.Firstly data analysis and exploratory data analysis is done.Then machine learning models are used and the best performing machine learning model is chosen and saved for predicting the real data.

 **House Price Prediction** 
 - Using the LSTM Neural Network, developed a model that can estimate the house rental price prediction accurately based on number of bedroom, size of the house, area type, location, furnishing status, and number of bathroom

 **E-Commerce Website** 
- Developed a website using PHP following MTV pattern where a user would be able to buy digital and physical products by adding them in their cart and make payment. Unit-Testing was done in this project to assure the functionality of different methods
